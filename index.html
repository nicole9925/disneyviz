                <p>In this data visualization, I analyze Disney song lyrics! I'd like to think that I am working with a comprehensive dataset of
                    lyrics (at the very least, it consists of all of the lyrics I could find on various lyric websites) and will assume so when 
                    making my analysis! Given the obvious nature of Disney songs - the lovey, happy nature - there is not much breathtaking information
                    to unveil from the lyrics, so I am approaching this project with the ultimate goal of visualizing the songs to determine key lessons and themes.

                    <p>The most initial visualization I began to make was one for the sole purpose of quantifying the lyrics 
                        and determining the most prevalent ones. This visualization contains only words that have been featured
                        in songs at least 150 times.<br><br> Prior to beginning the analysis process, 
                        I had thought that the word "love" would be the most common. However, the most common word ended up being "time."
                        "Time?" I thought. I could think of one song with the word time (Beauty and the Beast's "Tale as old as time" line), 
                        and I began to wonder which words "time" was used with, and what time could have possibly meant.

                    <p>To conclude the exploratory analysis phase, I set out to visualize the relationships between the most common words, through the number of songs they're in together. 
                        The colors represent the tone of the word -- blue as positive, pink as neutral. Notice that no negative words made it into my common words list -- it wasn't planned!
                        I figured that most of the words would fall under the same theme, thus would be used together often, and was right! 
                        <br><br>Please feel free to explore by yourself by clicking 
                        on the words to see the significant relationships a word has with others. The relationships are capped at 30, meaning that 
                        if a relationship is a part of less than 30 songs, it is not included, for readability.

                    <h1 style="font-size: 30px"> Overview of Song Sentiments</h1>
                    <p>To enter my actual analysis phase, the first thing I did was perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics of all of the songs in my dataset by using NLTK.
                        It is important to mention that though I only graphed the percentage of positive and negative words, there were also neutral words, so the sentiment
                        score in the tooltips are not completely reliant on the results of the two variables. This graph is quite difficult to gain information out of, and the color
                        spread is expected, but the extreme outliers are quite interesting to explore. For example, 'I'm Wishing' from Snow White has a whopping sentiment score of
                        0.9988, on a scale of -1 to 1 (negative to positive)! 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Below, we reimagine the above graph by now grouping the songs into their respective movies to see overall sentiment, based on a movie's average song sentiment score.
                        Due to the large quantity of songs, I decided to rank them by the most positive and most negative. Can we determine the general mood of a movie based on music sentiment
                        scores alone?

                    <p> Finally, based off of the information that we've gathered, we can make a few inferences: the most positive and negative song and movie!                    </p>
