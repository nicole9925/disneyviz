                            <p>Currently, I’m in my fourth year at UC San Diego, studying data science with a minor in political science! I’ve been active in a plethora of organizations, acting as chair of Active Community at Thurgood Marshall (a service organization) and media chair of Nikkei Student Union. I was also especially active in Kappa Alpha Pi, a pre-law fraternity and Side by Side (also a service organization). I even participated in a dance team (Division 12)!</p>

                            <p>Following the completion of my first data visualization class, I realized that I enjoyed studying and practicing the intersection of computer science and data science - analyzing data, then creating a visual experience to communicate it. Thus, I decided that the best way to do that would be to begin creating web applications. This job, my first official developer position, opened my eyes to the process of developing actual application deliverables to be used for the public, from the basics of working coorperatively remotely to extensive detail-oriented research to efficient programming.</p>

                            <p>I was an instructional assistant for UC San Diego’s “Principle of Data Science,” or DSC10. This was an introductory course to data science. This was by far one of the most rewarding jobs I have  had, as I was not only able to rekindle my initial interest and love of data science, but I was also able to contribute to UC San Diego’s data science community. Prior to this experience, I would tense up at the prospect of explaining statistics or programming concepts - I was able to overcome doing so and practice effectively communicating concepts during this job.</p>

                            <p>Through UC San Diego’s Academic Internship Program (or AIP), in which students can participate in an internship whilst receiving school credit, I was able to intern at the Qualcomm Institute. I was blown away by the innovative research in computer science and technology happening in front of my eyes. I developed a VR experience that helped induce sleep, based on research about the topic. As this was my first non-analytics project, I first felt the exhilaration of building a working product from ground up.</p>

                            <p>By this time, I had finished my first year studying data science. I spent majority of my time fulfilling data requests and researching/compiling information about consumers, and very quickly began to brainstorm methods to speed up these processes. I developed two projects: one that created a database of businesses in the area and programmatically assigned them to NAICS codes, a manual task that we normally spent hours a week working on, and another that automated their third-party requests validation process. </p>

                            <p>As a college freshman student studying political science, I had my mind set on becomming a lawyer. By the end of the year, after speaking to lawyers and learning more about the field, I decided that that was not the right path. Working at Arcina Risk Group was a formative experience for me, in terms of career, as it was my first time working in a corporate environment. I was not only able to speak to former lawyers, but I also learned the importance and potential of gaining technical skills in business.</p>

Teamwork, perserverance, confidence, and leadership are values that I have had more formal exposure to in my college years, but I still credit majority of what I’ve learned through my high school drumline, badminton, and other organization teams. Once a band geek...always a band geek?</p>

                        <p>Misinformation in this technological era has always been an area of interest for me. As a Chinese-American whose parents grew up in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong democracy movement was always a major point of discussion at the dinner table. Upon seeing news of Twitter banning hundreds of thousands of Chinese computational twitter bots directed at the Hong Kong protests, I immediately submitted a proposal to research this topic for HDSI’s Undergraduate Research Scholarship.</p>
