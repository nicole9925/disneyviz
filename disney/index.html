                <p>When you think of Disney songs, what do you think of? Love? Happiness? Empowerment? Me too. Pretty generic right?
                    In making this visualization, I wondered if I could find some insight into Disney songs how Disney songs are so original, yet generic 
                    at the same time, or make inferences about the song lyrics. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I used d3 to make the graphs/charts, co√∂rdinator for the image above, 
                    python [requests, pandas, BeautifulSoup, nltk (vader lexicon)] to webscrape/conduct sentiment analysis,
                    and www.disneyclips.com for lyrics.

                    <h1 style="font-size: 30px"> Common Words - EDA </h1>
                    <p>I began doing exploratory data analysis. The most initial visualization I began to make was one for the sole purpose of quantifying the lyrics 
                        and determining the most prevalent words. This visualization contains only words that have been featured
                        in songs at least 150 times.<br><br> Prior to beginning the analysis process, 
                        I had thought that the word "love" would be the most common. However, the most common word ended up being "time."
                        "Time?" I thought. I could think of one song with the word time (Beauty and the Beast's "Tale as old as time" line). 
                        I then quickly came to the realization that one word wouldn't tell me much that I didn't already know about Disney songs. 
                        And, knowing Disney, I had the hypothesis that all of the words were connected and played to similar themes.

                    <p>To conclude the exploratory analysis phase, I set out to visualize the relationships between the most common words, through the number of songs they are in together. 
                        The colors represent the tone of the word -- blue as positive, pink as neutral. Notice that no negative words made it into my common words list -- it wasn't planned!
                        I figured that most of the words would fall under the same theme, thus would be used together often.

                        on the words to see the significant relationships a word has with others. The relationships are capped at 30, meaning that 
                        if a relationship is a part of less than 30 songs, it is not included, for readability.

                    <h1 style="font-size: 30px"> Overview of Song Sentiments</h1>
                    <p>To enter my actual analysis phase, the first thing I did was perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics of all of the songs in my dataset.
                        It is important to mention that though I only graphed the percentage of positive and negative words, there were also neutral words, so the sentiment
                        score in the tooltips are not completely reliant on the results of the two variables. As expected, there are more positive songs than negative songs! 
                        The outliers are also interesting to explore. For example, 'I'm Wishing' from Snow White has a whopping sentiment score of
                        0.9988, on a scale of -1 to 1 (negative to positive)! 

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Below, we reimagine the above graph by now grouping the songs into their respective movies to see overall sentiment, based on a movie's average song sentiment score.
                        Due to the large quantity of songs, I decided to rank them by the most positive and most negative. Can we determine the general mood of a movie based on music sentiment
                        scores alone?

                                <p> As you can see, the positive movies consisted
                                    almost exclusively of romance movies, while the negative movies consisted of more adventure type movies. We can now

                                    compile the information that we've gathered, we can make a few inferences: 
                                    the most positive and negative song and movie!                     </p>
